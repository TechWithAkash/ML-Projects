# End-to-End Machine Learning Project 🧠

A modular and production-ready implementation of a complete machine learning pipeline, built for scalability, maintainability, and real-world deployment.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the full lifecycle of a machine learning application — from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment — using a modular and reusable codebase.

It is designed for educational purposes, portfolio building, and can serve as a template for real-world ML workflows.
